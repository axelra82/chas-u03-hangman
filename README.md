## About

This game is as simple as they come. You will be given a number of empty lines, where the **objective is** to choose **letters** and **guess** what the **word** is.</p>

### How to

- **Click** on the provided letters
- Or use the letters on your **keyboard**
- Once a letter has been selected it will be **disabled**
- **If your guess was correct** the letter will show instead of the placeholder(s)
  - *No points are deducted for correct guesses*
- **If your guess was wrong** one (1) point will be deducted, i.e. you'll have one less guess before **game over**
- To restart the game press the restart button in the upper right corner

**PS.** Don't bother checking the source code, their are no words in there ðŸ˜‰
